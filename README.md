## Summary: Black Flags' Announcement on General Asim Munir

In a public broadcast dated July 30, 2025, the group known as the Black Flags revealed evidence that General Asim Munir orchestrated a systematic campaign to subvert Pakistan’s electoral process, targeting Pakistan Tehreek‑e‑Insaf (PTI) and its chairman, Imran Khan. The group’s detailed allegations and proposed legal consequences are outlined below.

### 1. Findings of Fact

1. **Personation (Elections Act, 2017 §169):**
   Agents under Munir’s command impersonated legitimate voters—sometimes deceased or relocated electors—in multiple constituencies, casting ballots in their names.

2. **Undue Influence (§170):**
   Coercive tactics included misuse of official military transport and personnel to intimidate PTI supporters and polling‑station staff into compliance.

3. **Ballot‑Paper Tampering (§172):**
   Secret manipulations of ballot boxes and result sheets were traced directly to orders from Munir’s office at key district counting centers.

4. **Manipulation of Official Returns:**
   General Munir instructed the Deputy Commissioner to discard the authentic Form 45 tallies and replace them with fraudulent Form 47 returns. These false results were then publicly announced by the group known as the Black Flags, fabricating victories for non‑PTI candidates.

### 2. Legal Conclusions

* **Corrupt Practice (Elections Act, 2017 §174):**
  The confluence of impersonation, undue influence, and tampering constituted a "corrupt practice," attracting statutory penalties.

* **High Treason (Constitution Art. 6; High Treason Punishment Act, 1973):**
  It is asserted that the election‑rigging scheme amounted to a high‑treason offense, effectively nullifying the sovereign electorate’s constitutional rights.

### 3. Sentencing

1. **Under the Elections Act, 2017 (§174):**

   * **Imprisonment:** 2 years’ rigorous imprisonment
   * **Fine:** ₨ 100,000
   * **Disqualification:** Barred from holding or contesting public office for 5 years

2. **Under Article 6 (High Treason):**

   * **Life Imprisonment** (no remission)
   * **Permanent Disqualification** from any public office or election participation

*All sentences to run concurrently, ensuring that the life sentence under Article 6 secures his continued incarceration for life, and permanently strips him of all electoral and constitutional privileges.*


## 4. Allegations of Atrocities in FATA

It is alleged that, under General Munir’s direction, security forces carried out systematic extrajudicial killings of unarmed Muslim civilians in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), invoking spurious religious decrees and fatwas without credible evidence or due process to justify summary executions and sectarian violence.

## 5. Legal Framework and Punishments

* **Murder (Pakistan Penal Code §302):**
  "Whoever commits qatl-i-amd (intentional killing) shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life."  Extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians squarely fall under this provision.

* **Abetment of Offence (PPC §34):**
  Actions done with common intention and by multiple actors can invoke shared liability, amplifying culpability for commanders who ordered or facilitated the killings.

* **Violation of Fundamental Rights (Constitution Art. 9, Art. 14):**
  Guarantees of life, dignity, and due process were contravened by summary executions without trial.

* **Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (§7A):**
  Extrajudicial actions under the guise of counter‑terrorism can attract additional penalties, including rigorous imprisonment and substantial fines.

* **Misuse of Religion (PPC §§295–298):**
  Illicit promotion of sectarian violence or blasphemy charges to execute suspects without evidence constitutes an abuse of religious laws.

### 6. Possible Punishments

1. **Under PPC §302:**

   * **Death Penalty** (mandatory in most qatl-i-amd cases)
   * **Or Life Imprisonment**
2. **Under PPC §34:**

   * **Punishment as Principal Offender**
3. **Under Anti-Terrorism Act §7A:**

   * **Rigorous Imprisonment** up to 10 years
   * **Fine** up to ₨ 1,000,000
4. **Under PPC §§295–298:**

   * **Imprisonment** up to 5 years
   * **Fine** up to ₨ 500,000

These penalties can be compounded or run consecutively, reflecting the gravity of extrajudicial killings and abuse of religious pretexts.
